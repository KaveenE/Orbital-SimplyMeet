###### Motivation

Ever wish you had one centralised app where you can keep **track of the progress** of your group project? That’s where **SimplyMeet** comes in! 
University students have a large number of projects per semester. With the immense workload and various different components they need to focus on, it can be hard to keep track of everything related to their project in **one place**. It’s not just lessons that fill up our day but also the **numerous events** happening in NUS constantly. On top of everything, if you stay in hall, it’s no secret that there is probably an event every other day. It's a hassle to take all of these variables into consideration, so let **SimplyMeet** keep track of it for you.


###### Aim

**Primary:** Organize their timetable and events throughout the week to facilitate proper management of their day. 
**Secondary:** Keep track of project progress through the use of a to-do list.

###### Scope of Project

We will be using Flutter to create an android application that:
- Allows users to create events for a calendar and reminders for a to-do list. With all operations being CRUD-supported, everything is presented to them in a clean, concise and user-friendly manner.
- Hosts a notification service to push alerts and remind users of the upcoming tasks and events.
